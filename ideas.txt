AIStoryGenerator

- Use ChatGPT/OpenAI to generate a story based on a keyword/promt
- Tell it to always give two options how the story should continue
- When the user chooses one of the two options the AI will continue the story based on the option which was chosen
- First tell the AI that the parts of the story which it tells should not be long. Maybe 2-4 sentences, so that the user does not have to read a lot.
- In the background generate a picture based on the story and put the text on the picture maybe or below/above it.
